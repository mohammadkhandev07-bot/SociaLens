// This app stays a normal Next.js website - SSR pages, API routes, auth
// cookies, all of it. Capacitor's own "server.url" mode is what makes
// that work inside a native shell: instead of trying to export the app
// as static files (which would break the API routes, auth, and every
// Supabase Realtime call this app depends on), the native app simply
// opens this URL inside Android's built-in WebView. That's what removes
// both problems the TWA build had - there's no address bar to show
// (this is a real native Activity, not a browser tab), and there's no
// dependency on the Chrome app being installed/updated on the device
// (The WebView component ships with Android itself).
//
// Before running `npx cap sync android`, change `url` below to your
// production domain if that ever changes from the current Vercel one.
