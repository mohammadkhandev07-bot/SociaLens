/**
 * A 1x1 fully transparent GIF, used as the `poster` of every <video> in the
 * app.
 *
 * Why: a <video> with no `poster` attribute is drawn by Android's WebView
 * using WebChromeClient.getDefaultVideoPoster() - a small built-in bitmap
 * stretched to fill the whole element. That is the grey oval with the giant
 * play triangle that covered feed videos and reels in the APK. Desktop and
 * mobile browsers draw nothing there, which is why it never showed up on the
 * website.
 *
 * The native side already returns a transparent bitmap from that method (see
 * MainActivity.kt's SociaLensWebChromeClient), so this is the second half of
 * the same fix: giving the element an explicit poster means WebView never
 * reaches for its default in the first place - including inside any other
 * WebView (an in-app browser, another Android shell) that this app's pages
 * might be opened in, where our native override doesn't apply.
 *
 * It disappears the instant the video presents a real frame, so it never
 * hides actual video, controls, or fullscreen.
